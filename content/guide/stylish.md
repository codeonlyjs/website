# Stylish CSS Library

Stylish is the CSS library used by all the CodeOnly
samples and generated projects.  It's a separate
project to CodeOnly, which you may or may not wish
to continue using. 

> Stylish is a clean, simple, customizable, 
> theme aware, appearance only stylesheet.
>
> Stylish provides visual appearance styling 
> only, no script behaviours and no layout 
> functionality. This is intentional.
